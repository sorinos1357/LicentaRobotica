# LicentaRobotica
My first arduino project

If you want to compile/run this project on your Arduino follow this steps:

1. Copy the "Licenta" folder in "libraries" folder into your arduino install directory (Mine is in C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino)
2. Copy-paste the code from arduino.cpp into your Arduino IDE and that's it.
